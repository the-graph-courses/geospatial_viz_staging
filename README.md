# Geospatial Visualization with R

This is the staging repository for the geospatial visualization course under development by the GRAPH Courses. The course will be finalized and deployed fully by mid 2024. 

## Course Lessons

### 1. [Why R for GIS](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls01_why_r_for_gis)
Explore the reasons why R is a powerful tool for GIS and geospatial data analysis.

### 2. [Thematic Maps](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls02_thematic_maps)
Learn how to create thematic maps that convey specific data themes on geographical maps.

### 3. [Physical Features](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls03_physical_features)
Understand how to represent physical features on maps using R.

### 4. [Density Maps](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls04_density_map)
Discover how to visualize data density on maps, useful for population studies and resource distributions.

### 5. [Shapefile Data](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls05_shapefile_data)
Get hands-on experience with shapefile data and how it's used in creating detailed geospatial visualizations.

### 6. [Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls06_crs)
Dive into the world of CRS and learn how to manage geospatial data in different coordinate systems.

### 7. [Boundary Data](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls07_boundary_data)
Explore the use of boundary data in mapping regions, countries, and custom-defined areas.

### 8. [Foreign Objects](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls08_foreign_objects)
Learn about incorporating foreign objects.

### 9. [Understanding UTM](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls09_utm)
Gain insights into the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) systems for more precise location mapping.

### 10. [Working with Layers](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/geospatial_viz_staging/lessons/ls10_layers)
Master the art of layering in geospatial visualizations to create complex and informative maps.
