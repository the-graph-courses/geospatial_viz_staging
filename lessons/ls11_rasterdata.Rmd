Environmental data is recorded also as a *Grid of cells* and was used as *covariate* for the predictive geostatistical model.

![Figure 13. Altitude data from The Gambia.](images/pre-malaria-02.PNG)

The raw input for Geostatistical data is depicted as *Points geometries*. In this example, the point prevalence of each village.

![Figure 12. Point Prevalence of malaria in 65 villages in The Gambia.](images/pre-malaria-01.PNG)

A Grid of cells (also known as *Pixels*) contains in each cell information such as height, temperature, slope, forest cover, etc. These are often aerial photographs, satellite imagery, etc. These can also be used as *"basemaps"* below Thematic maps.

### Geographic data models: Raster data {.unnumbered}

**Raster Data** is a Grid of cells (e.g. *Pixels*) with each cell containing information such as height, temperature, slope, forest cover, etc. These are often aerial photographs, satellite imagery, etc. Rasters can also be used as *"base maps"* below vector data.

::: side-note
-   Density maps depict information using a *Grid of cells* or Pixels.

*Raster data* will typically be stored in *TIFF files*. Raster data classes are not supported by **sf**. It could be managed by the `{terra}` and `{stars}` packages.

We **read** Raster data using the `rast()` function from the `{terra}` package.

::: practice
Run this code to read Raster data. First, use `{here}` to specify the file path. Then, use `{terra}` to read the `.tif` file inside the `basic_geospatial_viz/data/gis/` folder:

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
pacman::p_load(terra)
pacman::p_load(here)

raster_path <- 
  here::here("basic_geospatial_viz",
             "data","gis",
             "GMB_altitude.tif")

raster_file <- terra::rast(x = raster_path)

raster_file
```
:::

We **plot** Raster data using the `plot()` function or combining the `{ggplot2}` and `{stars}` packages.

::: practice
Run this code to plot Raster data. Use `{ggplot2}` and `{stars}` to depict the altitude as a grid of cells from The Gambia:

```{r,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
pacman::p_load(stars)

ggplot() +
  geom_stars(data = st_as_stars(raster_file)) +
  coord_sf()
```

## Wrap up

In this lesson, we have learned about *Density maps*, which requires *Geostatistical data*, to represent intensity of a value in a certain area, using a *grid of cells*, and stored as *Raster data*.
