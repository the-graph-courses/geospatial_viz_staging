# from layers 

To make a more complete map of the Western province of Sierra Leona, Health facilities (`sf` object: point data) will be added to the map.

## external point data

We start by defining two Hospital sites (point data), according to their longitude and latitude, collected by GPS devices in the field, using the `read_csv()` function from the `{readr}` package:

```{r sites-sites}
sites <- readr::read_csv(here("basic_geospatial_viz/data/gps_healthsites.csv"))

sites
```

::: watch-out
-   The `{readr}` package is better used to read plain text files like *.csv*, *.tsv*, and also *.rds* files.

-   For **more data formats** like *.xlsx* or *.dta* you may prefer to read your data using the `readxl::read_xlsx()` and `haven::read_dta()` packages and functions, respectively.
:::

::: practice
Read the `gps_healthsites.xlsx` file. Use the `read_xlsx()` function from the `{readxl}` package.

```{r,eval = FALSE}
q1 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"
q1
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
.check_q1()
.hint_q1()
```
:::

## change point 

As such, we can adjust all characteristics of **points** (e.g. color of the outline and the filling, shape, size, etc.), for each `geom_sf()` layer. In this example, we set the two points as filled diamonds (`shape = 18`) with a bigger size (`size = 2`):

```{r sites-sf-plot}
ggplot() +
  
  # country map
  geom_sf(data = sierra_leone) +
  
  # hospital points
  geom_sf(data = sites_sf, mapping = aes(color = gps_name),
          shape = 18, size = 4) + # ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
  
  # map extent
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-13.5,-12.7), ylim = c(8.0,8.7))
```

### Fill district data with `{colorspace}` {.unnumbered}

Districts (polygon data) can be retrieved from local **shapefile** data. This time, only districts from Western province are retained:

```{r counties}
sierra_leone_shp <- 
  sf::read_sf(
    here(
      "basic_geospatial_viz/data/boundaries/sle_adm3.shp"
      )) %>% 
  filter(admin1Name=="Western")

ggplot(data = sierra_leone_shp) +
  geom_sf()
```

This time, for all the districts from the province retained, we are going to use the `area_km2` variable:

```{r}
sierra_leone_shp %>% 
  select(area_km2)
```

We can fill in the districts using their **area (in km^2^)** to visually identify the largest counties. For this, we use the [`{colorspace}` package](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/articles/ggplot2_color_scales.html) with some transparency. In this case, `area_km2` is a *continuous* variable, with a *sequential* scale type:

```{r counties-plot}
sierra_leone_shp %>% 
  ggplot() +
  # district filled by area
  geom_sf(aes(fill = area_km2)) +
  # color scale for fill
  colorspace::scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette="Reds 3", #ðŸ‘ˆ 
                                               alpha = 0.8)
```

::: vocab
The **scales** are called via the scheme

    scale_<aesthetic>_<datatype>_<colorscale>()

where:

-   `<aesthetic>` is the name of the *aesthetic* (fill, color, colour).
-   `<datatype>` is the type of the *variable* plotted (discrete, continuous, binned).
-   `<colorscale>` sets the type of the color *scale* used (qualitative, sequential, diverging, divergingx).

![Figure 2. *Fill* aesthetic with different *data types* plotted: Continuous and Binned.](images/colorspace_01.png)

![Figure 3. *Color* aesthetic for *discrete data* with different *color scale* types: Diverging and Sequential.](images/colorspace_03.png)
:::

::: pro-tip
A **Sequential** colors scale indicate:

-   Which values are *larger* or *smaller than* which other ones, and
-   How *distant two specific values are from each other*. This implies that the color scale needs to be perceived to vary uniformly across its entire range.

A **Diverging** color scale allows to:

-   visualize the *deviation of data values* in one of two directions relative to a *neutral midpoint*, usually is represented by a light color,
-   For example, a dataset containing both *positive* and *negative* numbers, and show how far in either direction it *deviates from zero*.

![Figure 4. Difference between Sequential and Diverging *color scale* types, with a *midpoint* in density equal to 0.02.](images/colorspace_02.png)
:::

::: practice
This is a ggplot map with the `afriairports` object:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
afriairports %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(color = elevation_ft))
```

Paste this code to your answer and:

Update the *color* aesthetic of the *continuous* variable `elevation_ft` of this map to a *diverging* scale, with a midpoint (`mid`) in `5000`.

```{r,eval = FALSE}
q3 <- 
  afriairports %>% 
   ggplot() + 
   geom_sf(aes(color = elevation_ft)) + 
   scale_....._......._.........(mid = ....)
q3
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
.check_q3()
.hint_q3()
```
:::

::: side-note
You can use `{colorspace}` package to:

-   emulate [color vision deficiency](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/articles/color_vision_deficiency.html) heatmaps with palettes, and
-   access [colorblind-friendly palettes](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/articles/ggplot2_color_scales.html#available-palettes) like Viridis and others.
:::

So, adding up all the previous layers, he obtain:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  
  # country map
  geom_sf(data = sierra_leone) +
  # province labels
  geom_sf_label_repel(data = sierra_leone %>% 
                        filter(shapeName!="Eastern"),       
                      mapping = aes(label=shapeName)) +
  
  # districts filled by area
  geom_sf(data = sierra_leone_shp,                   # ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
          mapping = aes(fill = area_km2)) +
  # color scale for fill
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette="Reds 3",
                                   alpha = 0.8) +
  
  # hospital points
  geom_sf(data = sle_healthsites_set) +
  
  # map extent
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-13.5,-12.7), ylim = c(8.0,8.7))
```

Given the overlap of filled districts over province labels, we can rearrange the `ggplot2` layers:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  
  # country map
  geom_sf(data = sierra_leone) +
  
  # districts filled by area
  geom_sf(data = sierra_leone_shp,                   
          mapping = aes(fill = area_km2)) +
  # color scale for fill
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette="Reds 3",
                                   alpha = 0.8) +
  
  # province labels
  geom_sf_label_repel(data = sierra_leone %>% # ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
                        filter(shapeName!="Eastern"),       
                      mapping = aes(label=shapeName)) +
  
  # hospital points
  geom_sf(data = sites_sf, mapping = aes(color = gps_name),
          shape = 18, size = 2) +
  
  # map extent
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-13.5,-12.7), ylim = c(8.0,8.7))
```

## Final map

For the final map, we put everything together, having a country boundary map based on the Sierra Leona map, with district delineations, province labels, main hospital names and locations, custom GPS collected field sites, as well as a theme adjusted with axis labels, and a north arrow and scale bar:

```{r,fig.width=8,fig.height=7}

  # districts filled by area

  # color scale for fill
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette="Reds 3", 
                                   alpha = 0.8) +
  
  # province names with repelled labels
  geom_sf_label_repel(data = sierra_leone %>% 
                        filter(shapeName!="Eastern"),
                      mapping = aes(label=shapeName)) +
  
  # hospital points 
  geom_sf(data = sites_sf, 
          mapping = aes(color = gps_name),
          shape = 18, size = 4) +
  
  # hospital points 
  geom_sf(data = sle_healthsites_set) +         
  # hospital names with repelled text 
  geom_sf_text_repel(data = sle_healthsites_set,         # ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ
                     mapping = aes(label = facility_name),
                     size         = 2,
                     fontface     = "bold",
                     force        = 0.5,
                     box.padding  = 0.6,
                     nudge_x      = -0.25,
                     direction    = "y",
                     hjust        = 1,
                     segment.size = 0.2) +
  
  # map annotation
  annotation_north_arrow(location="tl") +
  annotation_scale(location="bl") +
  
  # map extent
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-13.5,-12.7), 
           ylim = c(8.0,8.7)) +
  
  # ggplot labels
  labs(x = "Longitude",
       y = "Latitude",
       fill = expression(Area~km^2),
       color = "GPS data",
       title = "How are Tier 3 Hospitals distributed in the Western Province of Sierra Leone?")
```

# geometry columns

## can not be dropped

Recall that further above, we ran the following `select()` statement that asked for only two columns, `"name"` and `"pop_est"`:

```{r eval = F}
countries %>% 
  select(name,   # country name
       pop_est)  # estimated population
```

but this command returned **three** columns: `"name"`, `"pop_est"` and `"geometry"`. Why?

Since the `"geometry"` column holds the core geospatial data for an `sf` object, it is always included---it cannot be dropped in the normal ways.

To drop this column, you have to convert the object to a regular data frame with `as.data.frame()` or `as_tibble()` first:

```{r}
countries %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(name, pop_est) %>% 
  head()
```

(Of course, you usually should not need to drop the geometry column from your `sf` objects.)

## is recognized by geom_sf

So far you have been passing the `sf` object into `geom_sf()` without adding any arguments, for example:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = countries) + 
  geom_sf()
```

This is because `geom_sf()` automatically recognizes the geometry column and passes it in as an aesthetic. You can make this more explicit, by passing the column manually to the `geometry` argument:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = countries) + 
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(geometry = geometry))
```

-   The number of *features* are the number of rows in the **data frame**.
-   The number of *fields* are equal to the number of columns in the **data frame** minus one. It **excludes** the *last one* called **geometry**.

### Geometries {.unnumbered}

If we explore the **data frame** associated with the Spatial data objects, we identify that all of them have a **geometry** column at the end:

                geometry
       POINT (7.17 9.18)
       POINT (-0.2 5.56)
      POINT (38.74 9.03)
      POINT (3.04 36.77)
    POINT (47.51 -18.89)
     POINT (38.94 15.33)
     POINT (-7.99 12.65)
      POINT (18.56 4.36)
     POINT (-16.6 13.46)
     POINT (-15.6 11.87)

The text that appears below the **geometry** column its also detailed in the second line of the **header** of the output:

    Geometry type: POINT

Now, run these code chunks and identify which *Geometry* is detailed in their headers. These are Spatial data objects used until now for:

1.  *Choropleth maps*, and

```{r,eval=FALSE}

2.  *Physical features*

```{r,eval=FALSE}
